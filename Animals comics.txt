Animals a playing a football match against other animals. The refree is giving the opposite team a penalty.
They don't score. When Derek gets back with the ball, is it flat. Everyone think it is Derek's fault.
The ball was spiced by a hedgehog. They're stealing a new ball, from a mad bull. The end :)
